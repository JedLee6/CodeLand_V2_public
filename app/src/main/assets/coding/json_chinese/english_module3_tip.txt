3>1>Create a new variable, set this variable to 666, and finally output its value.
3>2>Create a new variable, set this variable to 527, increase its value by 1314, and finally output its value.
3>3>Create two new variables, set two variables to 123, 456, and output the multiplied values.
3>4>Create two new variables, set two variables to 78 and 910 respectively, and output the added values and multiplied values respectively.
3>5>Create three new variables, set the three variables to 12, 34, 56, and output the values after they are all multiplied.
4>1>Output "Success" if the condition is true.
4>2>Output "Success" if the condition is true; "Fail" if it is false.
4>3>With "3 <= 2" as the judgment condition, the true output is "Success", and the false output is "Fail".
